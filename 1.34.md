There will be some error about "2" not being a procedure.

## Explanation

It'll be easier if we define `f` like:

```scheme
(define f
  (lambda (g)
    (g 2)))
```
because then we can substitute a little more clearly:

```scheme
(f f)
```

```scheme
((lambda (g) (g 2))
 f)
```

Now let's replace the formal parameter `g` with the argument expression: `f` (which we could expand to it's definition, but there's no need quite yet)

```scheme
(f 2)
```

*Now* let's substitute `f`'s definition again:

```scheme
((lambda (g) (g 2))
 2)
```

```scheme
(2 2)
```

But `2` is not applicable!
