The procedure `a-plus-abs-b` selects the primitive procedure to use (`+` vs `-`) based on the sign of `b`. If `b` is negative, then `a-plus-abs-b` will "subtract" `b` from `a`. If `b` is positive, then `a` and `b` are simply added.
Nitpick: the procedure does not actually distinguish between negative numbers and zero; it only asks if the number is positive.
