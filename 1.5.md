If Ben was using an interpreter with <i>applicative-order evaluation</i>, then the expression would not return a value because evaluating `(p)` creates an infinite loop! In contrast, a <i>normal-order evaluator</i> (valid noun?) would not attempt to evaluate `(p)` because the <i>predicate</i> expression, `(= x 0)` when `x` is zero (which it is when Ben Bitdiddle attempts to evaluate the expression `(test 0 (p))`). Note that even though `if` retains its status as a special form in both kinds of evaluation, the procedure `test` that "wraps" this particular `if` does treat its arguments differently depending on the type of evaluation.
