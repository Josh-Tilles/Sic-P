My target audience is someone who already knows how to program and is
reading SICP in order to refine & enhance their existing skills and to
expand their mind. So, in my solutions, I try to demonstrate modern
Scheme implementations (which is stuff you can't get from the book)
and compare to other languages. Said another way: I'm not going to
bother restricting myself to only using what the authors have taught
at a given point.
