My target audience is someone who already knows how to program and is
reading SICP in order to refine & enhance their existing skills and to
expand their mind. So, in my solutions, I try to demonstrate modern
Scheme implementations (which is stuff you can't get from the book)
and compare to other languages. Said another way: I'm not going to
bother restricting myself to only using what the authors have taught
at a given point.

I expect to be using the following in my solutions:

- Racket (n√©e PLT Scheme)
- Chibi-scheme (to demonstrate R7RS stuff)
- probably Guile
- Clojure
