Here's the contextual code from the book

@(define (expt a b)
   b)

And here's something of mine that I think is handy:
@(define (half n)
   (n . / . 2))

Oh, but in this section, they define `halve`!
@(define (halve x)
   (/ x 2))

TODO: Exercise 1.18 has a pretty good explanation in it.

TODO: Exercise 1.19 would be a good candidate for an LP example.
