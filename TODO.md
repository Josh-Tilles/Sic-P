- Illustrate exercise 1.9 (pertains to recursive vs. iterative processes)
- Expand exercise 1.10
    - (has to do with Ackermann function)
    - Scribble
- Scan exercise 1.14 (create a tree illustrating the computation of `(count-change 11)`)
    - possibly redo it in some program to make it pretty
    - (also, answer question properly)
- In exercise 1.15, elaborate on complexity of `sine` procedure.
- Expand exercise 1.18 into a blog post (intuition about maintaining invariants).
