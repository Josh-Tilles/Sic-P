- Visualize exercise 1.6 by expanding and reducing a few rounds.
- Illustrate exercise 1.9 (pertains to recursive vs. iterative processes)
- Expand exercise 1.10
    - (has to do with Ackermann function)
    - Scribble
- Scan exercise 1.14 (create a tree illustrating the computation of `(count-change 11)`)
    - possibly redo it in some program to make it pretty
    - (also, answer question properly)
- In exercise 1.15, elaborate on complexity of `sine` procedure.
- Expand exercise 1.18 into a blog post (intuition about maintaining invariants).
- Exercises (from Chapter 1) 21–28
- Write up solution to exercise 35 (showing that \phi is a fixed point of x -> 1 + 1/x)
    - Use MathJax and/or Isabelle
    - Show hitting the wall, then subsequent later insight (esp. "how do I get rid of the radical?")
- Analyze/present the output from my solution of exercise 36:
